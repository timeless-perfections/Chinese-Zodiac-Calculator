What is the Chinese Zodiac?  Chinese astrology is a type of astrology that has been used for 4000 thousand years and describes people with 12 different signs and symbols. The Chinese Zodiac is an animal ring in which these 12 signs are evenly spaced (10 degrees wide) and has little to do with the stars.
